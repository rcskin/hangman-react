Hangman Game ReadMe (copied from README file inside project)

Intro:

This is a React app for playing the classic game of Hangman.

In this file, you will find instructions on how to install and run the application, as well as rules for playing the game.

Installation:

To install and run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal using the cd command, for example: cd hangman-react
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal: npm install
4. To start the app, run the following command in your terminal: npm start
5. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to play the game.

How to Play:

The game is simple!

1. Click one of the letter buttons you see to select the letter for your guess.
2. If you are correct, the letter will reveal itself where the word will be displayed.
3. If you are incorrect, the letter will be displayed to the left as a wrong letter, and an image will appear on the main display. The images will build a pole and noose, and then build a person including a head, body, arms, and legs.
4. You can continue guessing letters until you have guessed the entire word correctly, or until you have built the entire hangman, at which point you lose.
5. You can press "New Game" at any point to start again.
6. Have fun!
